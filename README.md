# Student-Enrollment-System--A-DBMS-based-Project

# 🎓 Student Enrollment System

> A smart and efficient DBMS project designed to simplify student admissions, course registrations, and academic record management.

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Student Enrollment System** is a database-driven application developed to automate the management of students, courses, enrollments, and academic records within an educational institution. The project replaces traditional manual record-keeping methods with a centralized and structured relational database system.

This system allows administrators to:
- 👨‍🎓 Manage student information
- 📚 Maintain course records
- 🧑‍🏫 Handle faculty and department details
- 📝 Track student enrollments
- 🔍 Retrieve records quickly using SQL queries

The project demonstrates important **DBMS concepts** such as:
- Relational Database Design
- Entity Relationship Modeling
- Normalization
- SQL Queries
- Primary & Foreign Keys
- CRUD Operations
- Data Integrity Constraints

# 🗄️ Database Design

The project uses a **Relational Database Model** consisting of the following tables:

| 📋 Table Name | 📖 Description |
|---|---|
| Students | Stores student information |
| Courses | Stores course details |
| Faculty | Stores faculty records |
| Departments | Stores department data |
| Enrollments | Stores course enrollment records |

---

# 🔗 Entity Relationship Overview

The system follows a structured relationship model:

- 🏫 One department can have many students
- 📘 One department can offer multiple courses
- 🧑‍🏫 One faculty member can teach multiple courses
- 👨‍🎓 One student can enroll in many courses
- 📚 One course can contain many students

The **Enrollments** table acts as a bridge table to handle the **many-to-many relationship** between students and courses.

# ⚙️ SQL Table Creation

## 👨‍🎓 Students Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    department_id INT
);
```

---

## 📚 Courses Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100),
    credits INT,
    department_id INT
);
```

---

## 📝 Enrollments Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    semester VARCHAR(20),
    enrollment_date DATE,
    
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id)
        REFERENCES Students(student_id),

    FOREIGN KEY (course_id)
        REFERENCES Courses(course_id)
);
```

---

# 🚀 Sample SQL Operations

## ➕ Insert Student Record

```sql
INSERT INTO Students
VALUES (
    101,
    'Rahul Sharma',
    'rahul@example.com',
    '9876543210',
    1
);
```

---

## ➕ Insert Course Record

```sql
INSERT INTO Courses
VALUES (
    201,
    'Database Management System',
    4,
    1
);
```

---

## 📝 Enroll Student into Course

```sql
INSERT INTO Enrollments
VALUES (
    1,
    101,
    201,
    'Semester 4',
    '2026-05-08'
);
```

---

# 🔍 Fetch Enrollment Details

```sql
SELECT 
    s.student_name,
    c.course_name,
    e.semester

FROM Students s

JOIN Enrollments e
    ON s.student_id = e.student_id

JOIN Courses c
    ON e.course_id = c.course_id;
```

### 📌 Sample Output

| 👨‍🎓 Student Name | 📚 Course Name | 📅 Semester |
|---|---|---|
| Rahul Sharma | Database Management System | Semester 4 |

---

# ✏️ Update Student Information

```sql
UPDATE Students
SET phone = '9999999999'
WHERE student_id = 101;
```

---

# ❌ Delete Enrollment Record

```sql
DELETE FROM Enrollments
WHERE enrollment_id = 1;
```

---

# 🧠 Database Normalization

The database is normalized up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to minimize redundancy and improve data consistency.

## ✅ First Normal Form (1NF)
- Atomic values only
- No repeating groups

## ✅ Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Removed partial dependency
- Full dependency on primary key

## ✅ Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Removed transitive dependency
- Improved maintainability
